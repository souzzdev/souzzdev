        <p align="justify">
            Systems Development student at ETEC, focusing on programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and Java.
            In addition to academic studies, I take a self-taught approach to improve my technical skills and explore new technologies and frameworks.
            I have hands-on experience in programming, systems analysis, and databases, particularly with MySQL, applying these skills to both academic and personal projects.
            My main interest is in software development, with a strong inclination to specialize in backend and build robust, scalable systems.
            I am looking for opportunities where I can apply and expand my knowledge, contributing to the development of innovative and efficient technology solutions.

<p align="justify">  
    Systems Development student at ETEC, focusing on programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and Java.  
    In addition to academic studies, I take a self-taught approach to improve my technical skills and explore new technologies and frameworks.  
    I have hands-on experience in programming, systems analysis, and databases, particularly with MySQL, applying these skills to both academic and personal projects.  
    My main interest is in software development, with a strong inclination to specialize in backend and build robust, scalable systems.  
    I am looking for opportunities where I can apply and expand my knowledge, contributing to the development of innovative and efficient technology solutions.
